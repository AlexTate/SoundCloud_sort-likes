This is a javascript snippet to sort SoundCloud feeds by likes.
It works on the main stream and user streams. To keep the code short, it will simply combine Spotlight and Recent sections when sorting user streams.

For easiest use I recommend creating a bookmarklet that contains the code.
1. Add a new bookmark
2. Name it whatever you like
3. In the url field, type "javascript:" without quotes
4. Paste the above code in the url field after "javascript:"
5. Click the bookmark on any SoundCloud feed that you wish to sort by likes
